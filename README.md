This is a minimal Maven project implementing an ImageJ 1.x plugin

It is intended as an ideal starting point to develop new ImageJ 1.x plugins
in an IDE of your choice. You can even collaborate with developers using a
different IDE than you.

In [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org), for example, it is as simple as
_File&gt;Import...&gt;Existing Maven Project_

In [Netbeans](http://netbeans.org), it is even simpler: _File&gt;Open_
Project. The same works in [IntelliJ](http://jetbrains.net).

If [jEdit](http://jedit.org) is your preferred IDE, you will need the [Maven
Plugin](http://plugins.jedit.org/plugins/?MavenPlugin).

Die-hard command-line developers can use Maven directly by calling _mvn_
in the project root.

However you build the project, in the end you will have the .jar file in the
_target/_ subdirectory. Simply copy it into your ImageJ's _plugins/_
directory, run _Help&gt;Refresh Menus_ and the plugin will be available in
_Process&gt;Process Pixels_ (this can be changed by editing
_src/main/resources/plugins.config_).

Developing plugins in an IDE is convenient, especially for debugging. To
that end, the plugin contains a _main()_ method which sets the _plugins.dir_
system property (so that the plugin is added to the Plugins menu), starts
ImageJ, loads an image and runs the plugin.

Since this project is intended as a starting point for your own
developments, it is in the public domain.
