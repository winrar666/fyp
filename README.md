This is a simple ImageJ 1.x plugin to inspect differences between two images.

To keep it reasonably simple, it uses the 'preview' function of an
ExtendedPlugInFilter, and a slider of a GenericDialog.
                                                                               It also serves as an example for how to use 'preview'.
